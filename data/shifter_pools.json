Unlike other Traits, Willpower has both a permanent rating and a temporary pool of points. The rating is rolled or tested, while the pool is spent. A character's Willpower pool will likely fluctuate during the course of a story or chronicle. It decreases by one point every time a player uses a Willpower point to enable their character to do something extraordinary, like maintain self-control or gain an automatic success. Willpower points can be regained during the course of a story.",
