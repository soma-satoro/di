        "description": "Willpower measures a character's inner drive and competence at overcoming unfavorable odds. Unlike other Traits, Willpower has both a permanent rating and a temporary pool of points. The rating is rolled or tested, while the pool is spent. A character's Willpower pool will likely fluctuate during the course of a story or chronicle. It decreases by one point every time a player uses a Willpower point to enable their character to do something extraordinary, like maintain self-control or gain an automatic success. Willpower points can be regained during the course of a story.",

The maximum number of blood points a vampire may ingest is dictated by their Generation, as is the number of blood points they may spend in a single turn. A vampire with zero blood points in their system is ravenously hungry and likely in the throes of frenzy.",
